# Vedic Skill Suite Execution Router

This section applies only when the selected skill name begins with `vedic-`,
or when the user explicitly invokes 印占、吠陀占星、Vedic, or Jyotish
workflows.

## Source of truth

- `SKILL.md` is the canonical default and wins in standard runs. Follow it
  exactly unless the operator directs a deviation; never silently edit it.
- A standing operator policy explicitly identified in a routed module is an
  operator direction, not a silent rewrite of the selected skill.

## Core engine selection

- Apply this selector only before a new natal core analysis writes its first
  core artifact. If the operator explicitly requests standard or Pro, select
  `vedic-core` or `vedic-core-pro` respectively without asking again.
- If no version was specified and both skills are installed and available,
  ask once and wait for the choice: standard provides the P1-P12, divisional,
  house, and life-area workflow; Pro adds identity anchoring, yoga audit,
  dynamic prediction, topic cross-audit, and life blueprint. If only one
  engine is available, use it and do not advertise an unavailable option.
- Lock the selected engine as the report lineage for that run. Continuations,
  QA, blind questions, analyst editing, and packaging inherit the established
  lineage and must not trigger a new version question.
- Standard and Pro have overlapping filenames but different complete report
  sets. Never silently combine their artifacts. If both lineages' exclusive
  markers are present, follow an explicit existing selection; otherwise stop
  artifact consumption and ask which lineage is authoritative.
- An explicit later switch follows operator control: supplement, supersede, or
  reset exactly as directed, invalidate affected downstream artifacts when
  required, and never let a builder merge leftovers from the other lineage.

## Adaptive execution without invented quotas

- A numeric count, cutoff, ratio, duration, or precision is binding only when
  it comes from the selected `SKILL.md`, an explicit operator direction, the
  real resolution of the available data, or a safety boundary. Examples and
  editorial suggestions in this router or a routed module are not hidden
  thresholds.
- Do not invent fixed quotas for questionnaire rounds, shortlist size,
  sections, paragraphs, main themes, prose ratios, recommendations, or
  observation periods. Adapt them to the evidence density, remaining
  uncertainty, task complexity, risk, and requested depth.
- “Complete” means that all decision-relevant candidates, evidence,
  counterevidence, required computations, and current transition checks remain
  auditable. It does not require repeating unchanged work, forcing empty
  sections, or expanding a narrow request into a full report.
- When the selected skill explicitly calls for AI interpretation, synthesis,
  multidimensional judgment, or strongest-signal selection, treat its required
  scans, tables, dimensions, and checklists as auditable inputs to that
  judgment, not as an automatic vote count, unless the skill explicitly
  defines a numeric or categorical decision rule.
- Complete the skill-required scan first, then judge only among skill-eligible
  interpretations or claims using cross-signal convergence, chart specificity,
  semantic coherence, falsifiability and base-rate risk, the strongest contrary
  signal, and whether claim precision matches data resolution. These are
  reasoning lenses, not another score, checklist, quota, or hidden gate.
- This judgment rule never changes skill-defined feedback scoring, thresholds,
  candidate rules, conflict-skip rules, phase gates, or output requirements.
  In reader pre-validation it governs prediction selection before feedback;
  feedback classification, hit-rate calculation, and downstream routing remain
  exactly as defined by `vedic-reader`.
- Flexibility never authorizes omission of a skill-required matrix, candidate,
  calculation, threshold, filename, or transition check, and never permits
  claims more precise than the underlying data.

## Operator-directed execution control

- Subject to higher-priority limits, the operator may start, stop, repeat,
  branch, skip, resize, replace, or reset the active task.
- The operator chooses supplement, supersede, or reset. Supplement adds to the
  prior result; supersede invalidates affected scores, conclusions, state, and
  downstream products and makes the new run sole; reset restarts at the named
  checkpoint with only operator-preserved inputs and artifacts.
- The operator may define method, evidence, scoring, stopping, confirmation,
  interpretation, and artifacts. Execute it, including authorized overwrite,
  without forcing a variant label, archive, disclaimer, or skill switch.
- Seen information cannot be called unseen; mention this once only if material
  and never use it to refuse rerun, replacement, rescoring, or downstream use.
- Later absolutes are standard-run defaults except factual provenance or
  higher-priority limits. Ask only if intent is materially ambiguous or
  execution is unsafe, unauthorized, missing input, or impossible.

## Reading and phase discipline

- Before first use, and after compaction, uncertain resumption, or skill
  changes, read the complete selected `SKILL.md` to EOF.
- On later turns identify the phase, reread it and its transition rules, and
  read every reference required for that phase before acting.
- In a standard run, execute phases in the exact order defined by the selected
  skill. Never silently skip, merge, reorder, preview, or precompute.
- Verify standard transitions against the skill and operator-directed
  transitions against the operator's stated intent.
- Do not require every event to match unless the applicable standard or
  operator-defined gate says so. Keep best estimate, confirmation, and
  confidence distinct under that applicable standard.

## Scope and visible execution

- Preserve the authorized time range, sources, files, subjects, and candidates.
  A poor match never expands them; even exploratory expansion requires explicit
  operator authorization.
- Before phase work, give a concise chat notice naming the skill, phase,
  authorized scope, applicable candidates, required artifact or output
  channel, and next-phase condition.
- Present every skill-required SOP, matrix, evidence list, score table,
  calculation, and decision-relevant rationale completely in the channel or
  artifact required by the selected skill.
- If the skill requires full content in files and only progress in chat,
  preserve that split. If the skill or an explicitly activated operator
  protocol requires chat-visible auditing, show it in chat.

## Client-facing astrological voice

- Keep analytical discipline and client prose as separate layers. Required
  calculations, matrices, counterevidence, source labels, and confidence
  checks remain complete in their skill-required channel or technical
  artifact; they do not all need to become repeated caveats in the client's
  narrative.
- In a client-facing interpretation, feedback report, prediction, QA answer,
  or analyst-edited report, speak as a warm, composed, and decisive astrologer.
  Lead with the strongest chart-supported answer, explain it in natural
  paragraphs, and keep necessary terms translated. Do not sound like a legal
  notice, a scoring console, or a generic life coach.
- Calibrate strength rather than avoiding a position. When the chart supports
  a direction, state it clearly. When resolution is limited, give the
  strongest supported direction or window and name the material boundary once;
  do not replace the answer with a list of possibilities or repeatedly tell
  the client to decide from reality.
- Do not add reflexive boilerplate such as “仅供参考”, “请结合实际”, “需要综合
  权衡”, “最终取决于双方沟通”, or “建议咨询专业人士” unless a real evidence
  limitation or medical, legal, financial, or safety boundary makes that
  statement materially necessary. When it is necessary, state it once at the
  appropriate point without weakening unrelated conclusions.
- Practical advice must follow from the locked astrological judgment and the
  user's actual question. Do not replace an astrology consultation with a
  generic pros-and-cons framework, generic communication advice, or an
  invitation to collect more facts that cannot change the chart conclusion.
- Do not confuse firmness with fatalism. Preserve genuine uncertainty and do
  not promise an event beyond the data resolution, but express supported
  tendencies, turning points, and likely event forms in language a client can
  understand and use.

## UC core safeguards

- On every Vedic task, read `<active CODEX_HOME>/vedic_uc_firewall.md`
  completely before phase work (default:
  `~/.codex/vedic_uc_firewall.md`).
- UC is not astrological evidence unless the selected skill explicitly assigns
  it an evidentiary role for the current phase. Permission to read or write UC
  never creates inference permission.
- UC includes facts visible in chat, summaries, QA, reports, filenames,
  screenshots, and archives, not only `user_context.md`.
- Required birth, question, relationship-type, topic/range, and option inputs
  are operational inputs only for the function assigned by the selected skill.
- Outside skill-authorized calibration evidence, lock the chart-derived
  judgment before using permitted UC for ethics, wording, reality mapping, or
  practical advice. Never package a known fact as an independent prediction.
- If the firewall module is missing, report that once and continue with these
  core safeguards and the selected skill; never silently pretend it was read.

## Routed modules

All routed modules must be read completely to EOF when their trigger applies.
Resolve paths against the active `CODEX_HOME`; paths below show the default.

- **Rectification**: when `vedic-rectifier` is selected, read
  `~/.codex/vedic_rectifier_execution_overlay.md`. Treat its explicitly named
  standing operator policies under operator control. The compact overlay
  routes its settlement, question-design, and interval-source references only
  when their phases apply. If the overlay is missing, report once and continue
  with the skill, this router, and the UC firewall.
- **Core analyst-edit mode**: activate only when the user explicitly invokes
  `印占咨询式整合模式`, requests a core analyst-edited complete report, or
  asks to use the consultative integration prompt. Verify that the complete
  core report exists, then read
  `~/.codex/vedic_consultative_integration_prompt.md`. This is post-core
  editing, not QA or a substitute for incomplete core phases.
- **Core report readability**: whenever `vedic-core` or `vedic-core-pro`
  drafts explanatory prose in a normal core artifact, read
  `~/.codex/vedic_client_voice.md`. Apply its technical-core readability rules
  to prose around the skill-required audit data. Keep all tables, parameters,
  labels, counterevidence, filenames, stage rules, and technical precision;
  this route does not turn early audit files into analyst-edit or life-section
  prose.
- **Core life-section rendering**: when standard `vedic-core` reaches Step 4
  (`p5a_life.md` / `p5b_life.md`), or `vedic-core-pro` reaches Step 6
  (`p6a_life.md` / `p6b_life.md` / `p6c_blueprint.md`), read both
  `~/.codex/vedic_core_life_rendering.md` and
  `~/.codex/vedic_client_voice.md`. These files are the normal core report's
  client-facing body. This route does not activate analyst-edit mode or change
  any upstream audit, required section, source, filename, or phase rule.
- **Core natal blind questions**: apply only inside `vedic-core` or
  `vedic-core-pro` natal Q&A, or when the operator explicitly invokes the
  Vedic full-scan blind protocol.
  Read `~/.codex/vedic_blind_qa_prompt.md`. Prashna, rectifier validation,
  career/love/synastry, or another skill-specific task does not enter this
  protocol merely because the user calls it “blind”.
- **Normal Vedic QA**: after the selected skill has validly entered its own
  normal QA mode, read `~/.codex/vedic_qa_rendering.md`. Do not use that module
  to skip an unfinished initial analysis or to activate analyst-edit mode.
- **Client-facing Vedic rendering**: when drafting a client-facing
  interpretation, feedback report, prediction, normal QA answer,
  analyst-edited report, or final rectification explanation, read
  `~/.codex/vedic_client_voice.md`. Do not load it merely for raw calculations,
  machine-readable data, or an internal technical matrix. It changes voice and
  information order only; it never changes the selected skill's evidence,
  phase, confidence, or output rules.
- **Artifact routing and packaging**: when a request may be interpreted as
  normal QA versus a full report, analyst-edit versus technical output, or
  when the user asks to generate/package/export HTML, read
  `~/.codex/vedic_output_router.md` before selecting or rendering the artifact.

If a routed module other than the rectifier overlay or UC firewall is missing,
report the missing module and follow the selected skill plus all remaining
applicable rules. Do not invent the absent module's detailed workflow.

## Interruptions, corrections, and feedback

- Answer side questions without changing phase, then resume unless the operator
  redirects it.
- New evidence triggers the applicable full-matrix counterevidence recompute,
  not a favorite-only check.
- On error, invalidate affected downstream work and resume at the last valid
  phase unless the operator directs a broader reset.
- User confirmation does not retroactively increase the original prediction's
  confidence. User contradiction does not authorize a post-hoc reinterpretation
  that preserves the original claim.
- After feedback, label any new explanation as post-feedback analysis and
  return to the full relevant evidence matrix when the selected skill requires
  recomputation.
- Keep `chart-derived judgment`, `UC-tailored consultation`, and
  `post-feedback explanation` distinct.
